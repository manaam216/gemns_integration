```

## Usage

### Adding Devices

#### Automatic Discovery
- Devices are automatically discovered when connected to BLE/Zigbee dongles
- The integration scans for new devices every 30 seconds
- Device status is updated in real-time via MQTT

#### Manual Device Addition
1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Devices & Services** ‚Üí **Gemns IoT**
2. Click **Add Device**
3. Fill in the device information:
   - **Device ID**: Unique identifier
   - **Device Name**: Display name
   - **Device Type**: BLE, Zigbee, or Generic
   - **Category**: Sensor, Switch, Light, Door, or Toggle
   - **BLE Discovery Mode**: V0 Manual or V1 Auto (for BLE devices)

### Controlling Devices

#### Sensors
- **Leak Sensors**: Show moisture levels (0-100%)
- **Vibration Sensors**: Display motion/vibration data
- **Temperature/Humidity**: Standard environmental readings
- **Air Quality**: CO2 and other air quality metrics

#### Switches
- **On/Off Switches**: Basic on/off control
- **Door Switches**: Door open/close status
- **Toggle Switches**: State-based switching

#### Lights
- **RGB Control**: Full color spectrum control
- **Brightness**: 0-255 brightness levels
- **Color Temperature**: Warm to cool white adjustment
- **Transitions**: Smooth color/brightness changes

### BLE and Zigbee Management

#### Protocol Toggles
- Use the integration's configuration options to enable/disable BLE or Zigbee
- Toggles are available in the integration settings
- Changes take effect immediately

#### Connection Status
- **Binary Sensors**: Show BLE and Zigbee connection status
- **Real-time Updates**: Status changes are reflected immediately
- **Dongle Information**: View connected dongle details

## MQTT Topics

### Status Topics
- `gemns_iot/status` - Integration status updates
- `gemns_iot/dongle/{port}` - Dongle status information
- `gemns_iot/device/{device_id}` - Device updates

### Control Topics
- `gemns_iot/control/ble` - BLE toggle commands
- `gemns_iot/control/zigbee` - Zigbee toggle commands
- `gemns_iot/device/{device_id}/command` - Device-specific commands

### Command Format
```json
{
  "command": "turn_on",
  "device_id": "device_123",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "brightness": 255,
  "rgb_color": [255, 0, 0]
}
```

## Device Status

### Status Types
- **Connected**: Device is actively communicating
- **Offline**: Device is not responding (automatic after 5 minutes)
- **Connecting**: Device is in pairing mode
- **Identified**: Device is recognized but not fully paired
- **Paired**: Device is fully paired and managed
- **Error**: Device has encountered an error

### Offline Behavior
- Devices automatically show as offline after 5 minutes of inactivity
- This simulates real-world device behavior
- Status updates are sent via MQTT for real-time monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Integration Not Loading
- Check that all required files are in the correct directory
- Verify MQTT broker is accessible
- Check Home Assistant logs for error messages

#### Devices Not Appearing
- Ensure BLE/Zigbee toggles are enabled
- Check MQTT connection status
- Verify dongles are connected and responding

#### MQTT Connection Issues
- Verify MQTT broker URL and credentials
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure MQTT integration is working in Home Assistant

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging in Home Assistant:
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.gemns_iot: debug
```

## Development

### Architecture
- **Device Manager**: Handles device discovery and management
- **MQTT Client**: Manages communication with the add-on
- **Platform Entities**: Home Assistant entity implementations
- **Configuration Flow**: UI-based setup and configuration

### Adding New Device Types
1. Create new platform file (e.g., `fan.py`)
2. Implement required entity methods
3. Add to platform list in `__init__.py`
4. Update constants and translations

### Testing
- Use the integration with the WePower IoT add-on
- Test device discovery and control
- Verify MQTT communication
- Check entity state updates
